Scilab Control System Toolbox Development

Overview:
This project focuses on developing the Control System Toolbox for Scilab, implementing essential control system functions similar to those available in Octave’s 'control' package. The aim is to enhance Scilab’s capabilities in control system analysis and design.

Features:
1. Implementation of key control system functions in Scilab
2. Mirroring functionalities from Octave's 'control' package
3. Support for system modeling, stability analysis, and controller design
4. Enhancing computational capabilities for control engineering

Technologies Used:
1. Scilab – Open-source numerical computation software
2. Control System Theory – For function implementation
3. Octave ('control' package) – Reference for function replication

Usage:
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/cassia-crypto/Scilab-Control-System-Toolbox.git
   cd Scilab-Control-System-Toolbox

2. Load the toolbox in Scilab:
   exec('src/your_function.sci', -1);

3. Use the implemented functions to analyze control systems.

Contribution:
Contributions are welcome! If you’d like to enhance the toolbox, please:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch (feature-new-function)
3. Submit a Pull Request (PR) with a detailed description
